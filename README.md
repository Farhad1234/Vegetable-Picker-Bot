# Vegetable-Picker-Bot
PROBLEM STATEMENT


Develop a bot that can differentiate between ripe and raw vegetables and gather the ripe ones before they fall down and contaminate.
The bot has to manoeuvre in the vegetable farm and has to pick the ripped vegetables without harming the plant. The base of the bot should not exceed 500mm x 500mm. The plant height may not exceed 1000 mm. The bot has to collect the vegetables as many as possible (in a single lot) to reduce the work time. The will deploy the vegetables at a given site and go for the next lot. Choose the plant wisely!
